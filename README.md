#Raspberry Pi Startup Scripts
#If you cant identify your raspberry pi's IP adress on connection to Wifi (Airport or closed network), these tools can help
* 'gmailSend.py': uses gmail login and app password to send an email to yourself upon startup
* 'telegramChat.py': uses telegram's api to connect and send a message to yourself
* 'telegramChatAlt.py': another method to send using telegram's api if the first one doesn't work
* 'telegramBot.py' uses "botfather" on telegram to send a message via your own custom telegram bot
* If none of these work, please reach out to me for more info, and of course feel free to edit the code to fit your needs
